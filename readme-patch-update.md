To address the concerns raised in the mailing list reply regarding potential resource usage and security implications of enabling SSL certificate compression in Nginx, update the patch as follows:

1. **Add Configuration Limits:**
   - Introduce configuration directives to set limits on the maximum allowable memory usage per connection due to certificate compression.
   - Introduce a configuration directive to control the maximum allowable expansion size for decompressed certificates.

2. **Resource Usage Monitoring:**
   - Implement mechanisms to monitor and log resource usage when SSL certificate compression is enabled.
   - Provide warnings or errors if resource usage exceeds acceptable thresholds.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Ensure that the patch includes a "no compression" option by default, and document the potential risks associated with enabling compression.
   - Perform a thorough security review and include mitigations for known vulnerabilities related to compression.

4. **Configuration Validation:**
   - Add validation logic to ensure that the configured limits are within acceptable ranges and prevent misconfigurations.

### Summary of Changes
1. **New Configuration Directives:**
   - `ssl_certificate_compression_max_uncompressed_size`: Sets the maximum uncompressed size for the certificate.
   - `ssl_certificate_compression_max_memory_per_conn`: Sets the maximum memory usage per connection due to certificate compression.

2. **Validation Logic:**
   - Checks if the configured values for `max_uncompressed_size` and `max_memory_per_conn` are within acceptable ranges (between 1 and 16 MB).

3. **Logging:**
   - Logs information about enabled SSL certificate compression and configured limits for monitoring and troubleshooting.

These changes address the concerns by providing administrators with the ability to configure and control the resource usage related to SSL certificate compression, ensuring that memory usage is kept within acceptable limits, and logging critical information for monitoring and security auditing.
